## Mod 11 Homework

### Readings

As I said in lecture, there is a lot to learn about mapping. Most of this will be practice, practice, practice! That, and learning how to solve new mapping questions and problems on your own. In this homework there are SEVERAL to-do items.

If you are brand new to mapping, at some point I recommend you read this tutorial (this is not required):
- https://socviz.co/maps.html

For everyone, I want you to work through the code from this tutorial written for this class by a Vanderbilt colleague! Many of you will want to skip this. Do not skip this (this is required).

For class next week, I want you to, BY TUESDAY:

- read this overview of factor analysis (largely, PCA) http://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/CourseSessions/Sessions23/FactorAnalysisReading.html

BY THURSDAY:

- fork (or download a zip) of this repository: https://github.com/InseadDataAnalytics/INSEADAnalytics


## Last, make a map.

Make any map with the following requirements:

(1) Your map should be of a region such as a city, state, or country (or the world). Do not go smaller than a city. Do not do a single county.

(2) Your visualization should then print data on the map. You can shade regions by colors or use points, or toy with the density mapping in the Nigeria example. You decide.

(3) Write 3-5 clear sentences interpreting your map. What does is show? What can we reliably understand from it?

If you do not have something off the top of your head you want to map, one place to start is to map events from ACLED, which is what we did for the Nigerian case. You can register for an API here which lets you easily download the data online. https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/

**Due Date for coding map: Nov. 12 Thursday before class**
